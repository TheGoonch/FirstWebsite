Html - Builder
CSS - Artist
Js - wizard
All 3 are front end dev

+Html
Basically use <> as a delimeter to encapsulate elements
<!DOCTYPE html> -- specifies version
<html>
-code here
</html>
  ^--> the / means the end of an element

*Paragraph
<p>some text content</p>

-void elements have no closing tag
-->img, and br

*Attributes
<html lang="en">
        ^--> specifies the languaged used in that element

*Head element, contains important meta info for webpages so no element about displays inside important
ex:
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> - should always have head enclosing it
    <title>My First Webpage</title> -- gives webpage human readable title
  </head>
</html>

-meta element charset is basically allowing the use of special characters
-if title isn't there it'll defualt to the file name

-body, it's were all the content is contained
<body>
--content here
</body>

^--> all of this is boiler plate so just use ! in the first line for vs code which
     generates all of the code for the basics

+Working with texts
-<p> is Paragraph
-<h1> is a header
    - you can do <hn>, n representing a number and it'll
    create smaller and smaller headers
